# predicting-house-prices-lowa
This project is based on the kaggle competition for predicting the house prices. The idea is based on applying Multiple linear regression algorithm to study the coloumns and design an algorithm which can help in minimizing the RMSE value which means creating the algorithm which can accurately predict the house prices with least error rate.
